## Project Description

We employed JavaScript, Node.js, and the React Library to build a client-side single-page weather application that provides users with a 7-day forecast for the city or country of their preference.


The motivation behind this project was to deepen our understanding of developing a fully functional front-end web application using JavaScript, the React library in conjunction with Three.js and other technologies.

## Installation instructions

- Install  your preferred IDE.
- In terminal or Gitbash, navigate to the directory you want to copy the repository into. 
- Run the command ```git clone git@github.com:GabiDragh/Project-2.git```
- Run the command **git pull** to ensure you have the latest version.
- Open the project in the preferred IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
- In the intergrated terminal, start by running the command ```npm install``` to install all the necessary dependencies for this project.
- Next run the command ```npm run dev``` to start the application in the browser.

## Usage
To access the weather forecast for any country or city, simply enter the name in the search box located in the top-left corner of the webpage. The current weather, along with a suggestion from our charming Weather Rebel mascot, will be displayed in the main/hero section of the webpage. The forecast for the next seven days will appear in the carousel just below the main section.

For testing the responsiveness of our website across different screen sizes:

1. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (macOS). This will open a console panel to the side or below the webpage in your browser.
2. Look for the devices icon situated to the left of the 'Elements' button within the DevTools panel.
3. You can manually input a specific size to test responsiveness, or click on the 'Dimensions' button, usually located just below the website URL, and select a device from the dropdown list to emulate its screen size.
